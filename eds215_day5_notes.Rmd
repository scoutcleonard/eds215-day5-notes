#### Stuff that sounds important! 

- A class of statements called **alter** that allow you to change things in the schema. 
- `dbExectute()` sends instructions to the database that do not use tables 
-

**Commond** + **shift** + **C** comments out a bunch of code at once! 

#### Bash commands: 

- `cut`: 
- `uniq` shows the lines that are unique
- `uniq -d` shows the lines that ~aren't unique~ 
  - you have to `sort` first and then pipe into `uniq` command 
  - `sort` goes through observations in order 
  - `sort -u` is a faster way of saying `sort | uniq` 
  - `uniq -c` give a count of how many unique values encountered
